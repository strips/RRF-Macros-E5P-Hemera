For use as example in creating your own macros only!

Be careful executing the macros. Check them in a text editor first to make sure they are safe for your printer. Some macros include motor movement and motor current commands specific to my individual printer and may not work on yours without modification. Most macros are printer agnostic and simply add a gcode function as a button to PanelDue or DWC.

Tuning macros can be found in Tuning.zip. They are contained in a zip file due to the very high number of files included.
